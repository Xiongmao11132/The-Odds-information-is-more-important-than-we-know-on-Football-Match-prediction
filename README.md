The Odds information is more important than we know on Football Match prediction

## Abstract

Soccer is a popular sporting activity and the growth of the sports betting industry is closely related to it. To better predict the outcome of matches before the game, many researchers use machine learning methods to make predictions. However, the outcome of a soccer match is affected by factors such as weather, player conditions, and tactical choices. These variables are difficult to quantify numerically, thus hindering the application of machine learning in soccer match prediction. We find that pre-match odds data can reflect the effects of these complex variables to some extent. In addition, we created a benchmark dataset that includes La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, UEFA Champions League, and the English Premier League, totaling 54,130 matches. We have carefully processed and organized this data to make it more suitable for model training and testing. To confirm the importance of the odds data, we have conducted extensive experiments using machine learning methods. The experimental results prove that odds information can improve the prediction accuracy of various machine learning techniques. Visualization experiments demonstrate that odds ratio information can better cluster the same category while improving classification accuracy.
