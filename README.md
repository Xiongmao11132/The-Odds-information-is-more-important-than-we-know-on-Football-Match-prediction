Exploiting the Potential of Odds Information on Football Match Prediction

## Abstract

Soccer is a hot sports activity for a long time, which drives the sports betting industry to flourish. In order to obtain better predictions before the game, many researchers use machine learning methods to predict the results. However, predicting the results of football matches is influenced by numerous factors, including weather, player conditions, and stadium conditions. These variables are challenging to quantify digitally, which can hinder the application of machine learning algorithms in football match prediction. We have found that pre-match odds data can, to some extent, reflect the impact of these complex variables. Furthermore, numerical information is more suitable for input into machine learning models. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we have created a benchmark dataset comprising 54,130 matches, including La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, Ligue 1, and Champions League as well as the English Premier League. We have carefully processed and organized this data to make it more suitable for model training and testing. In order to confirm the importance of odds data, we have conducted extensive experiments with a wide range of machine learning methods. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that odds information can enhance prediction accuracy across various machine learning techniques. Visual experiments prove that odds information can better cluster the same category while improving classification accuracy.
